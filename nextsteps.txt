add an aws glue thing where a python file generates data (just 3 customers) in the format of Square POS customer data incl customer contact data and orders in squareposAPI format, and ships it to s3 (through cicd) to a customer_contacts and customer_orders tables (2 tables) and then using glue a glue job transforms it into one digestible table for agents to work with. and edit the crew agents tasks workflow to ingest the mock square pos data for deciding which customers to send emails to then another agent drafts emails for each customer and the third agents sends the emails (for now the sending of emails is simulated so dont actualyl send emails) so the crew probably needs actual tools for this but email stuff not needed yet.

example emails, "Sarah your carbonara awaits" (Sarah ordered carbonara twice in last 6 months in the data), or "John come get another All American Burger and we'll give you all free toppings on us" (John has ordered All American Burger 3x it's time we show some love with an offer that saves him money), or "Arfonzo come again we bet you'll grow to like it here! Have a free drink and side with your next entree order, for up to 3 people during your next visit." (Arfonzo ate at our restaurant once a couple months ago and ordered three entrees so he couldve been there with his family or a group). Generate the three customers' data exactly as Ive described in the explanations just above, so the results can be relatively easily validated that the agents are generating similar outreach emails to these. 

the main puirpose of this pivot is to create a new project building on the last one, now simulating data source connection with Glue, and next steps after this will be to add real emails.

Actually, add evshlom@gmail.com for the emails for all 3 customers in the data, so the emails will actually send to one of my throwaeway email accounts so i can see it work in real time. lets do that. so incluide real emailing in this project include whatveer crewai tools are needed for the agent sto do their jobs (in theaiawsattack prpject earlier we werent using any tools)
